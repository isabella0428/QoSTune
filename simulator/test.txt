No DB drivers specified, using mysql
Running the test with following options:
Number of threads: 1

Doing OLTP test.
Running mixed OLTP test
Using Special distribution (12 iterations,  1 pct of values are returned in 75 pct cases)
Using "BEGIN" for starting transactions
Using auto_inc on the id column
Maximum number of requests for OLTP test is limited to 10000
Threads started!
Time limit exceeded, exiting...
Done.
